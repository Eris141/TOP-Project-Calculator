# TOP-Project-Calculator
TOP-Calculation-Project

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Responsive Input Handling: Ensures only one operator can be entered between numbers, and prevents multiple decimal points from being added within a single number.
Error Handling: Detects invalid inputs like division by zero and provides appropriate error messages without freezing the application, allowing the user to restart the calculation.
Limit on Display: The calculator limits the input to 9 digits to keep the display clean and user-friendly.
Challenges Overcome
Input Validation: Ensured proper validation for handling operator placement, preventing multiple decimal points, and restricting leading decimals (e.g., .1 becomes 0.1).
Error Recovery: After displaying an error (e.g., division by zero), the calculator allows the user to reset and start fresh without requiring a full page reload.
Styling: The calculator was styled from scratch, improving the visual appeal and user experience.
Lessons Learned
This project was a valuable learning experience that taught me more about:

DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
Error handling and validation in user input.
Advanced CSS techniques for creating responsive and visually appealing layouts.
